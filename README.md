## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make optimal decisions through interaction with its environment. Rather than learning from pre-labeled examples like in supervised learning, the agent learns by trial and error—taking actions, observing the results, and using feedback in the form of rewards to improve future decisions.

### Core Concepts in RL:

- **Agent** – The decision-maker that interacts with the environment.
- **Environment** – The world the agent operates in and receives feedback from.
- **State** – A snapshot of the current situation the agent is in.
- **Action** – The set of possible moves or decisions the agent can take.
- **Reward** – A numerical signal that evaluates the action taken.
- **Policy** – A strategy that maps states to actions.
- **Value Function** – An estimate of expected future rewards from a given state.

Reinforcement learning is powerful for tasks requiring sequential decision-making and has applications in robotics, gaming, autonomous systems, and financial modeling.

## My Project

### **Grid World MDP**

- **Category:** Finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)  
- **Description:** A grid-based simulation where an agent navigates a grid to optimize rewards, following the MDP framework.  
- **Techniques Used:** State transitions, reward dynamics, policy evaluation, and value function computation.
